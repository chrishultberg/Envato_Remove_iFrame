# Google Chrome Extension for Envato<br/>Add "Remove Frame" to Preview Page
<br/>
Mid December, 2020 - Envato decided that it would be best to remove the "Remove Frame" from it's header on the Preview Pages.
<br/><br/>
Note:<br/>This was in hopes of increasing conversion rates (sales).
<br/>
Developers know this can create problems due to the use of iFrame's.

Installing this extension will automatically add the "Remove Frame"<br/>
to the right-side of the "Buy Now" button at the top of the page.
