## Overview
### A Google Chrome Extension for Envato Market - Preview Pages<br/>
Mid December, 2020 - Envato decided that it would be best to remove the "Remove Frame" link.
<br/><br/>
This was in hopes of increasing conversion rates (sales).<br/>
Developers know this can create problems due to the use of iFrame's.<br/>
<br/>
Installing this extension will automatically add the "Remove Frame"<br/>
to the right-side of the "Buy Now" button at the top of the page.
